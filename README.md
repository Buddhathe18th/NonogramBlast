# Nonogram Blast

This is a personal project to solve Nonogram 

The files to solve nonograms are in the [Solver](./Solver/) directory. The [Tools](./Solver/tools.py) is the file with the solutions algorithm, and [test.py](./Solver/test.py) is the one running the solving.

All other files (for now) are all tests for both graphics and image recognitions, for future stuff.
